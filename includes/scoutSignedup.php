For the few badges that do have a limited number of slots, we will try to honor your preferences. If these sessions do fill up, though, spots will be awarded based on age (with rank as a tiebreaker).</p><p>Keep in mind that signing up for badges online does NOT force you to take those badges at camp. While online signup will help ensure that a spot is available for you, it is up to you whether you want to take advantage of that spot. You're signing up for summer camp, not junior year of college; our staff isn't going to make you take a badge just because you clicked a button on the internet four months ago. Still, having accurate records of merit badge preference helps the MaKaJaWan staff prepare for the summer. If your merit badge plans for this summer change, you can simply resubmit your preferences by clicking the 'Sign Up For Merit Badges' button above. In order to give you the best summer possible, we strongly encourage you to keep us updated in this way. Thanks for using MyKaJaWan, and see you this summer!</p>";
